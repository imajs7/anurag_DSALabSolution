### Reverse Linked List Programme: output
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 45 -> X  
LinkedList Head = 10  
LinkedList Tail = 45  
20 found in list!  
25 not found in list!  
Error : Cannot delete 35. Element not found!  
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 45 -> X  
45 -> 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> X  
  
### Find Lowest common ancestor: output
22 <- 23 -> 34  
21 <- 22 -> X  
X <- 21 -> X  
X <- 34 -> X  
  
LCA (by recursive method) for node{21} & node{4} is node{20}  
LCA (by iterative method) for node{20} & node{22} is node{20}  
  
### Stack implementation using queue
Stack Implementation Using Two Queues  
  
Stack Operations  
1. push  
2. pop  
3. check empty  
4. size  
5. peek  
1  
Enter the value to be pushed: 52  
Stack = 52   
Do you want to continue (Type y or n) y  
Stack Operations  
1. push  
2. pop  
3. check empty  
4. size  
5. peek  
1  
Enter the value to be pushed: 25  
Stack = 25 52   
Do you want to continue (Type y or n) y  
Stack Operations  
1. push  
2. pop  
3. check empty  
4. size  
5. peek  
5  
Peek Element: 25  
Stack = 25 52   
Do you want to continue (Type y or n) y  
Stack Operations  
1. push  
2. pop  
3. check empty  
4. size  
5. peek  
3  
Empty status = false  
Stack = 25 52   
Do you want to continue (Type y or n) y  
Stack Operations  
1. push  
2. pop  
3. check empty  
4. size  
5. peek  
4  
Size = 2  
Stack = 25 52   
Do you want to continue (Type y or n) y  
Stack Operations  
1. push  
2. pop  
3. check empty  
4. size  
5. peek  
2  
Popped Element = 25  
Stack = 52   
Do you want to continue (Type y or n) n
